# now you have set up an auto-payment triggered on every minute
# to change the triggering duration, you need to change the "* * * * *" on step 4
# the "* * * * *" can be seen as "m h d M D", which can be read as
# "the mth. minute of the hth. hour of the dth. day of the Mth. month of the year. (plus every Dth. day of the week)"
# for more detail, google "crontab generator".
# any generator would be fine
